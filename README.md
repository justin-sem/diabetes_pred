# CLASSIFICATION & PREDICTION OF DIABETES

The diabetes data used in this project is obtained from 'Vanderbilt Biostatistics Datasets', https://hbiostat.org/data/
These data are courtesy of Dr John Schorling, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine.

The data consist of 19 variables on 403 subjects from 1046 subjects who were interviewed in a study to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia for African Americans. According to Dr John Hong, Diabetes Mellitus Type II (adult onset diabetes) is associated most strongly with obesity. The waist/hip ratio may be a predictor in diabetes and heart disease. DM II is also agssociated with hypertension - they may both be part of "Syndrome X". The 403 subjects were the ones who were actually screened for diabetes. Glycosolated hemoglobin > 6.5 is usually taken as a positive diagnosis of diabetes. Process of data analysis and modelling is written and illustrated comprehensibly in the notebook.

The best model is hosted via Steamlit as a data product which can be access via: https://diabetespred-8ybboe8fd99p7gbjkfju2r.streamlit.app/ (Inactive)
